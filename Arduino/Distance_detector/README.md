# Distance detection by ultra sonic sensor

## About
This is a personal project where I intended to build a device that could help people in every day life. 

The device is attached to the top of a monitor and when the user breaks the activation distance the RGB LED will turn on, the buzzer will active and a message will appear on the LCD telling the user to back away from the monitor. 

The activation distance can be changed to the users preference.
